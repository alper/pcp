Rust.MCP wants to be more state-of-the-art than GeCode, to be faster than a SAT solver, and to make you feel NP like P.

Or maybe this is just a simple constraint solving library.

* The [csar](https://github.com/soli/csar) Rust library by Sylvain Soliman helped me to get started and propagators equivalences are mostly taken from this library.
* The thesis of Guido Tack – Constraint Propagation - Models, Techniques, Implementation – and the GeCode library are a huge source of inspiration.
* The ideas behind search tree and transformers from monadic constraint programming will be used in this library.
